VIDEO_PROMPT = """Write a motivational video script based on the title "{title}" designed for a YouTube audience that challenges conventional thinking and inspires viewers to take control of their lives. The script should be structured with a powerful introduction, an in-depth body that exposes societal or systemic constraints, and a compelling conclusion that calls the audience to immediate action.

Engaging Opening:
all content must be based on the title -> "{title}"
More motivational Opening based on the title -> "{title}"
if need take a real story or a real scenario based on the title -> "{title}"
Must end with a hook that grabs the audience's attention based on the title -> "{title}"
Start with a bold, provocative statement (e.g., 'You are not free' or a similar hard-hitting phrase) to grab attention immediately.
Set the stage by questioning common societal norms or limitations.
Explanatory Body:

Explain how everyday systems (like the 9-to-5 work model or traditional education) limit personal freedom and financial independence.
Describe the negative impacts (debt, lack of savings, etc.) and use vivid, metaphorical language (e.g., 'modern slavery without chains').
Introduce the idea that true freedom comes from taking control—through developing skills, multiple income streams, or entrepreneurial pursuits.
Call-to-Action Conclusion:

End with a strong motivational message that empowers viewers to break free from these constraints.
Include a clear, actionable step or challenge (for example, 'start building your escape plan today').
Optionally, integrate SEO-friendly keywords such as 'financial freedom,' 'escape the matrix,' 'entrepreneur mindset,' and 'self-improvement.'
Tone and Style Guidelines:

Use direct, unapologetic, and empowering language.
Maintain a conversational yet forceful tone that resonates emotionally.
Optionally include timestamps or visual cues to indicate transitions for a video format.

Take the following script and transform it into a JSON array of sentences. For each sentence in the script, do the following:

Ensure that it ends with a proper stopping punctuation (e.g., a period, exclamation mark, or question mark).
Improve the sentence structure by inserting additional commas where needed to enhance clarity and readability.
Output only a valid JSON list of sentences (i.e., an array of strings) with no additional text or formatting.

let me tell you the truth you are not free you were never free from the moment you were born the system was designed to turn you into a worker not a boss Society doesn't teach you how to build wealth it doesn't teach you how to be independent it teaches you how to be obedient look around how many people do you know hate their jobs but feel like they have no choice but to keep working how many people live paycheck to paycheck with zero savings constantly worried about rent bills and debt this is by Design they want you
distracted they want you tired they want you too exhausted to question the system they fill your mind with Netflix celebrity drama and meaningless debates while they keep taking your money and your time you were trained for this trained to obey from a young age they told you go to school get good grades get a safe job with benefits work hard and one day you'll retire happily This Is A Lie they don't want you to wake up they don't want you to realize that you don't have to live this way the 9 to5 system is modern slavery
the only difference is now instead of chains they keep you trapped with debt taxes and fear but here's the truth they don't want you to know you don't need a job to survive you don't need a degree to make money you don't need to waste your best years making someone else Rich the real question is are you going to keep playing their game or are you ready to escape what if I told you that school is the biggest scam in the world think about it you spend 15 to 20 years in school memorizing useless facts taking
standardized tests and learning how to follow orders but no one teaches you how to start a business how to invest your money how to build wealth why because they don't want you to be financially free they want you to be just smart enough to operate the machines send the emails and do the paperwork but not smart enough to question why you're working 40 plus years just to retire broke and the worst part they make you pay for your own brainwashing you take out student loans that put you in decades of debt just to get a degree
that doesn't guarantee you a job by the time you graduate you're already financially crippled and guess what the people who make the real money the CEOs the entrepreneurs the investors didn't follow this system system Jeff Bezos dropped out Elon Musk taught himself Richard Branson no degree they didn't waste time memorizing useless history dates they learned how to make money so why are you still following the script they gave you they don't need whips and chains anymore they use money debt and
fear taxes eat your paycheck before you even touch it inflation makes sure your money loses value every year credit cards and loans keep you in an endless cycle of debt and what happens if you stop working you lose everything but do you know who never loses the people at the top the CEOs the politicians the billionaires they own the system and guess what they don't work a 9 to5 the rich don't trade time for money they make money work for them it's time for you to do the same stop thinking like an employee
start thinking like an owner the reason you're stuck in the 9 to5 trap is because you've been programmed to believe that's your only option it's not the first step to Escaping The Matrix is realizing you're in it you don't need a boss you don't need a 401k you don't need job security you need need financial intelligence multiple streams of income a high income skill a business that prints money while you sleep and the good news you don't need to be rich to start let me break it down for you from the moment you wake up to the
moment you go to bed every system around you is designed to keep you in the 9 to-5 Matrix think about your daily routine you wake up to an alarm clock because your time doesn't belong to you you sit in traffic for an hour just to go to a job you hate you work all day making someone else Rich you come home too exhausted to do anything productive you watch TV scroll social media get distracted you repeat the process until you die this is not life this is a script you been forced to follow because the
system never wanted you to be free they tell you to save money but inflation is stealing your savings they tell you to buy a house but you'll spend 30 years paying the bank they tell you to work hard but hard work alone never made anyone Rich the system is a game and you've been playing it wrong it's not about hard work it's about Leverage The people who escape the 9 to5 Matrix don't work harder they work smarter But first you need to see the game for what it really is the first and most dangerous thing they did to you was
program your mind to accept a limited reality your parents your teachers your friends they all told you the same thing check mark get a degree find a state able job work for 40 years retire at 65 let me ask you who does this actually benefit not you not your family it benefits the system they want you thinking like a worker because workers keep the machine running but you were never meant to be a worker You Were Meant to Be Free the rich and Powerful teach their kids a different mindset own don't rent
invest don't just save build don't follow control your time don't trade it for money the only way to escape the 9 to-5 Matrix is to reprogram your mind you have to stop thinking like an employee and start thinking like a producer an owner an entrepreneur and that starts today if your only source of income is your paycheck your one step away from Financial ruin the moment your boss fires you you have nothing and this is why the rich never rely on one income Source they have businesses that pay them even when they
sleep Investments that grow without their effort passive income streams that print money for them the broke man has one source of income the rich man has many and the good news you don't need to be rich to start building multiple income streams the goal replace your 9 to-5 paycheck with income you control now that you know the truth it's time to take action write down every source of income you have right now how much money do you make how much of it do you actually keep what happens if you lose your job
tomorrow the reason most people stay broke is because they are distracted stop wasting time on Netflix stop scrolling Tik Tok for hours stop watching sports while your own life is falling apart pick one skill and start making money from it sell your skill as a freelancer start a YouTube channel or blog build a digital product once you have money coming in don't waste it invest it buy stocks that pay you dividends buy assets that appreciate in value reinvest into your own business once your side income is making
as much as your job salary quit never again trade your time for money people will doubt you people will call you crazy people will laugh at you let them the second you start Building Wealth outside the system The Matrix will try to pull you back in they will tell you that's too risky just be happy with what you have why don't you get a normal job ignore them most people are slaves and they hate seeing others escape but once you start making real money Everything Changes no boss no alarm clocks no
paycheck anxiety you control your life you control your time you are free the biggest mistake people make waiting I'll start next year I'll start when I have more time I'll start when I feel ready you will never feel ready the world is changing fast AI is replacing jobs inflation is destroying savings the system is rigged to keep you poor if you don't start building your own Escape Plan now you will wake up 10 years from now still stuck in the same cycle and by then it will be too [Music] late the choice is yours stay in the 9
to5 Matrix keep working keep struggling keep waiting for a miracle that will never come take action now start building start earning start escaping most people will never Escape most people will stay stuck but you you have a choice are you going to keep following their script or are you going to rewrite your own story The Escape begins now [Music]
